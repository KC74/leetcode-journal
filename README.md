# LeetCode Journal

Welcome to my LeetCode journal repository. Each of my problems will include an initial planning phase where I will define the problem in my own words, how I'm going to approach the problem, and everything will be written out in psuedocode first.

As I work through the problems, I'll log the areas which I get stuck on, how I intend to solve the issue, and why it worked or why it didn't.

At the end of each problem, a review will be done by writing a summary on what I've learnt, what worked and what didn't, but also as to why. Any other closing thoughts will also be included in the summary.
